[*]IMPORTANT: This mod requires the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=684509615]UI Overhaul 1080p mod[/url] in order for the 5-section Flagship to display properly in the ship designer. If you don't care about how the UI looks in the ship designer, you can use this mod alone with no issues.

[*][b]HOW TO RESET NSC:[/b] If your copy of the mod is not working properly, delete this entire folder from your PC: Steam\SteamApps\workshop\content\281990\683230077 and then unsubscribe and resubscribe to the mod. Verify that Steam is downloading the mod, and then try to run again. You may have to repeat this step a few times to get it working. This is becoming a common problem with Steam and we cannot fix it from our end.
